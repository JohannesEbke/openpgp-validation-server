Hi!

We received a mail from "{{.Requester}}" asking to validate that the OpenPGP Key
with the fingerprint "{{.Fingerprint}}" belongs to you.

Since you were able to decrypt this message, this is very probably the case.
To confirm that you are owner of this key, click here:

http://{{.Host}}/confirm/{{.Nonce}}

After the confirmation, we will sign your OpenPGP key and send it to you. We will
not upload it to any keyservers.
